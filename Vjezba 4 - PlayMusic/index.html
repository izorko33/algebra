            Fernando" is a song written by Benny Andersson and Björn Ulvaeus,
            from the Swedish musical group ABBA. The song was written for their
            fellow group member Anni-Frid Lyngstad and was included on her 1975
            album Frida ensam
        </p>
        <p>
            The following year, "Fernando" was re-recorded by ABBA. It was
            released in March 1976 as the brand new track for the 1976
            compilation album Greatest Hits, and was also included on the
            group's fourth studio album Arrival in Australia and New Zealand.
            "Fernando" is also featured on the multi-million-selling Gold:
            Greatest Hits compilation. The song is one of ABBA's best-selling
            singles of all time, with six million copies sold in 1976 alone.[2]
            It is one of fewer than forty all-time singles to have sold 10
            million (or more) physical copies worldwide, making it one of the
            best-selling singles of all time.

            "Poison" is a song by American musician Alice Cooper. Written by
            Cooper, producer Desmond Child and guitarist John McCurry, the song
            was released as a single in July 1989 from Cooper's eighteenth
            album, Trash. It became one of Cooper's biggest hit singles in the
            United States, peaking at number seven on the Billboard Hot 100. The
            power ballad[6][7] performed even better in the UK by peaking at
            number two on the UK Singles Chart. "Poison" remains one of Alice
            Cooper's best known songs. It is ranked by Billboard as the "91st
            top song of 1989", while Ultimate Classic Rock ranked it as the "7th
            best Alice Cooper song", commenting "Poison sounds like a typical
            '80s pop-metal number at times, but Cooper’s intensity brings it to
            a whole other level."[8] The song's main riff was written by
            guitarist John McCurry, who two years earlier had used it for the
            John Waite track "Encircled"

            The song is available as downloadable content (as part of the Alice

            "Beautiful Day" is a song by Irish rock band U2. It is the first
            track on their tenth studio album, All That You Can't Leave Behind
            (2000), and was released as the album's lead single on 9 October
            2000. The song was a commercial success, helping launch the album to
            multi-platinum status, and is one of U2's biggest hits to date
        </p>
        <p>
            Like many tracks from All That You Can't Leave Behind, "Beautiful
            Day" harkens back to the group's past sound. The tone of the Edge's
            guitar was a subject of debate amongst the band members, as they
            disagreed on whether he should use a sound similar to that from
            their early career in the 1980s. The band's lead vocalist Bono
            explained that the upbeat track is about losing everything but still
            finding joy in what one has.
